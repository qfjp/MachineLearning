Breif idea: 
===========
Based on some Graph features, how can we predict some target values.
We target here two different ideas
  1-Learning from a dataset and apply the learned model to a similar dataset (dataset from the same domain of knowladge)
  2-Learning from a dataset and apply the learned model to a different dataset (corss domain knowladge)

Extracted Graph Features
========================
1-RoleX

Basis Functions
===============

Learning function of the target
===============================
In this part we can learn the target value directly or we can learn some functions of the target.

Learning models
===============
Supervised Learning:
 -Regression:
   1. Linear Regression
   2. Logistic Regression
 -Classification:
   1. Neural Network
   2. SVM 
   3. KNN (k nearest neighbours) 
Unsupervised Learning:
-Classification:
  Kmeans
